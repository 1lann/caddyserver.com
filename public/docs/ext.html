			<h1>ext</h1>

			<p>
				ext allows your site to have clean URLs by assuming a file extension when the path of the URL does not end with one.
			</p>

			<p>
				An extension in the URL is detected by checking the last element of the path for a dot (<code>.</code>).
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			
			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">ext</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>extensions...</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>extensions...</b> is a list of space-separated extensions (including the dot) to try. Extensions will be tried in the order listed. At least one extension is required.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Suppose you have a file called /contact.html. You could serve that file at /contact by having Caddy try .html files.
			</p>

			<p>
				To try .html, .htm, and .php in order:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">ext</span> <span class="hl-arg">.html .htm .php</span></code>
