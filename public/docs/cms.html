			<div class="addon-message">
				<div class="heading"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Addon</div>
				This directive is a Caddy extension. Questions should be directed to its maintainer. <a href="https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms">github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				cms allows you to deploy and manage a static site with a web-based admin interface where you can edit content, schedule posts, upload files, etc. The admin interface will be available at /admin on your website.
			</p>

			<p>
				By default, it uses <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> - which is bundled with the plugin so you don't have to install it separately - but you can use any other static website generator.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Requirements:</b> This add-on does not create a new Hugo site for you; you'll need to run <code>hugo new site</code> if you don't already have a Hugo site. If you want to use an external static website generator, it must be in your <code>$PATH</code>.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
      <code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">root</span>  <span class="hl-subdirective">public</span>
      <code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">cms</span>  <span class="hl-subdirective">workingdir</span></span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">styles</span>  <i>file</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">command</span> <i>cmd</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">content</span> <i>folder</i>
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>public</b> is the folder with the public content.</li>
				<li><b>workingdir</b> is the folder where the commands are going to be executed. By default, it is the current working directory.</li>
				<li><b>file</b> is the relative path to <code>public</code> folder of the admin UI styles. These styles won't replace the defaults, they will be added.</li>
				<li><b>cmd</b> is the command you want to execute. It must be surrounded by double quotes and, if the content is only flags, they are parsed as Hugo arguments, if it begins with something else, it will execute the whole command. You can use it to use another static website generator.</li>
				<li><b>folder</b> is the folder where the posts and pages are placed.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				All of the directives above are optional.
			</p>

      <p>
				To schedule a post, its <code>date</code> field must be in '2006-01-02 15:04:05-07:00' format.
			</p>

      <p>
				This directive should be used with <a href="/docs/root">root</a>, <a href="/docs/basicauth">basicauth</a> and <a href="/docs/errors">errors</a> middleware to have the best experience. See the examples to know more.
			</p>
