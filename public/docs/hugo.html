				<strong>hugo fills the gap between Hugo and the browser.</strong> <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is an easy, blazing fast and awesome static website generator. This plugin fills the gap between Hugo and the end-user, providing you an web interface to manage the whole website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using this plugin, you won't need to have your own computer to edit posts, neither regenerate your static website, because you can do all of that just through your browser.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
      <code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">hugo</span> <span class="hl-arg">[<i>dir</i>]</span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">styles</span> <i>file</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">args</span>   <i>cmd</i>
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>dir</b> (optional) is the folder where the commands are going to be executed. By default, it is the current working directory. Default: <code>./</code>.</li>
				<li><b>file</b> (optional) is the relative path to public folder of the admin UI styles. These styles won't replace the defaults, they will be added.</li>
				<li><b>cmd</b> (optional) must be surrounded by double quotes and it corresponds to the Hugo flags you want to use.</li>
			</ul>

      <p>
				This directive should be used with <a href="/docs/root">root</a>, <a href="/docs/basicauth">basicauth</a> and <a href="/docs/errors">errors</a> middleware to have the best experience. See the examples to know more.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you still <strong>don't</strong> have an Hugo website, don't worry. This plugin will auto-generate it for you. But that's not everything. I recommend you to take a look at Hugo <a href="http://gohugo.io/themes/overview/">documentation</a> to learn more about themes, content types, and so on.

				A simple Caddyfile to use with Hugo static website generator:
			</p>

     		<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">root</span>      <span class="hl-arg">public</span>           <span class="hl-comment"># the folder where Hugo generates the website</span>
<span class="hl-directive">basicauth</span> <span class="hl-arg">/admin user pass</span> <span class="hl-comment"># protect the admin area using HTTP basic auth</span>
<span class="hl-directive">hugo</span>                       <span class="hl-comment"># enable the admin panel</span></code>
