			<h1>hugo <div class="tag addon">Addon</div></h1>

			<div class="addon-message">
				<div class="heading"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Addon</div>
				This directive is a Caddy extension. Questions should be directed to its maintainer. <a href="https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo">github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				hugo allows you to deploy and manage a static site with an web-based admin interface where you can edit content, schedule posts, upload files, etc. The admin interface will be available at /admin on your website. It is built to be used with <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> - which is bundled with the plugin so you don't have to install it separately.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Requirements:</b> this add-on does not create (yet) a new Hugo site for you; you'll need to run <code>hugo new site</code> if you don't already have a Hugo site.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
      <code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">root</span>  <span class="hl-subdirective">public</span>
<span class="hl-directive">hugo</span>  <span class="hl-subdirective">dir</span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">styles</span>  <i>file</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">args</span>    <i>cmd</i>
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>public</b> is the folder with the public content.</li>
				<li><b>dir</b> is the folder where the commands are going to be executed. By default, it is the current working directory.</li>
				<li><b>file</b> is the relative path to <code>public</code> folder of the admin UI styles. These styles won't replace the defaults, they will be added.</li>
				<li><b>cmd</b> must be surrounded by double quotes and it corresponds to the Hugo flags you want to use.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				All of the directives above are optional.
			</p>

      <p>
				To schedule a post, its <code>date</code> field must be in '2006-01-02 15:04:05-07:00' format.
			</p>

      <p>
				This directive should be used with <a href="/docs/root">root</a>, <a href="/docs/basicauth">basicauth</a> and <a href="/docs/errors">errors</a> middleware to have the best experience. See the examples to know more.
			</p>
