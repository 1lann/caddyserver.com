				This directive is a Caddy extension. To get it, select this feature when you <a href="/download">download</a> Caddy. Questions should be directed to its maintainer. <a href="https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo">github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo</a>

				hugo fills the gap between Hugo and the browser. <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is an easy and fast static website generator. This plugin fills the gap between Hugo and the end-user, providing you an web interface to manage the whole website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using this plugin, you won't need to have your own computer to edit posts, neither regenerate your static website, because you can do all of that just through your browser.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
      <code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">hugo</span> <span class="hl-arg">[<i>dir</i>]</span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">styles</span> <i>file</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">flag1</span>   <i>value1</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">flag2</span>   <i>value2</i>
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>dir</b> (optional) is the folder where the commands are going to be executed. By default, it is the current working directory. Default: <code>./</code>.</li>
				<li><b>file</b> (optional) is the relative path to public folder of the admin UI styles. These styles won't replace the defaults, they will be added.</li>
				<li><b>flags</b> are optional and they refer to the Hugo available flags. Please use their long form without "--" in the beginning. If no value is set, it will be evaluated as "true".</li>
			</ul>

      <p>
				This directive should be used with <a href="/docs/root">root</a>, <a href="/docs/basicauth">basicauth</a> and <a href="/docs/errors">errors</a> middleware to have the best experience. See the examples to know more.

				If you don't already have an Hugo website, don't worry. This plugin will auto-generate it for you. But that's not everything. I recommend you to take a look at Hugo <a href="http://gohugo.io/themes/overview/">documentation</a> to learn more about themes, content types, and so on.

<span class="hl-directive">basicauth</span> <span class="hl-arg">/admin user pass</span> <span class="hl-comment"># protect the admin area using HTTP basic auth</span>
<span class="hl-directive">hugo</span>                       <span class="hl-comment"># enable the admin panel</span></code>
