			<h1>log</h1>

			<p>
				log enables request logging. The request log is also known from some vernaculars as an access log.
			</p>



			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			
			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span></code>

			<ul>
				<li>With no arguments, an access log is written to access.log in the common log format for all requests (base path = /).</li>
			</ul>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>file</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>file</b> is the log file to create (or append to). The base path is assumed to be /.</li>
			</ul>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>path file </i>[<i>format</i>]</span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>path</b> is the base path to match in order to be logged</li>
				<li><b>file</b> is the log file to create (or append to)</li>
				<li><b>format</b> is the log format to use (default is Common Log Format)</li>
			</ul>


			<h3 id="file">Log File</h3>

			<p>
				The log file can be any filename. It could also be <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> to write the log to the console, or <code>syslog</code> to write to the system log (except on Windows). If the log file does not exist beforehand, Caddy will create it before appending to it.
			</p>


			<h3 id="format">Log Format</h3>

			<p>
				You can specify a custom log format with any <a href="/docs/placeholders">placeholder</a> values. Log supports both request and response placeholders.
			</p>


			<h3 id="rotate">Log Rotation</h3>

			<p>
				If you enable log rotation, log files will be automatically maintained when they get large or old. You can use rotation by opening a block on your first line, which can be any of the variations described above:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg">...</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">rotate</span> {
		<span class="hl-subdirective">size</span> <i>maxsize</i>
		<span class="hl-subdirective">age</span>  <i>maxage</i>
		<span class="hl-subdirective">keep</span> <i>maxkeep</i>
	}
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>maxsize</b> is the maximum size of a log file in megabytes (MB) before it gets rotated. Default is 100 MB.</li>
				<li><b>maxage</b> is the maximum age of a rotated log file in days, after which it will be deleted. Default is to never delete old files because of age.</li>
				<li><b>maxkeep</b> is the maximum number of rotated log files to keep. Default is to retain all old log files.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Log all requests to a file:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg">/var/log/access.log</span></code>


			<p>
				Custom log format:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg">/ ../access.log "{proto} Request: {method} {path}"</span></code>

			<p>
				With rotation:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">log</span> <span class="hl-arg">access.log</span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">rotate</span> {
		<span class="hl-subdirective">size</span> 100 <span class="hl-comment"># Rotate after 100 MB</span>
		<span class="hl-subdirective">age</span>  14  <span class="hl-comment"># Keep log files for 14 days</span>
		<span class="hl-subdirective">keep</span> 10  <span class="hl-comment"># Keep at most 10 log files</span>
	}
}</code>
