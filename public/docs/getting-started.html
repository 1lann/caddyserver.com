			<h1>Getting Started with Caddy</h1>

			<p>
				This page will help you get up and running with Caddy on your local machine or on a remote server. You'll want to be familiar with the command line since Caddy is not a visual application.
			</p>

			<h3>Quick Start</h3>

			<ol>
				<li><a href="/download">Download Caddy</a> for your platform and put it in your PATH.</li>
				<li><code>cd</code> to the folder containing your website.</li>
				<li>Run <code>caddy</code>.</li> 
			</ol>

			<p>
				Open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:2015">http://localhost:2015</a> to see it working.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you see a message like "404 Not Found" then Caddy is working but the directory from which you are running Caddy probably doesn't have an index file (index.html).
			</p>

			<h3>Configuring Caddy</h3>

			<p>
				Customize how Caddy serves your site by placing a text file called Caddyfile next to your site. You can actually name the file anything and put it anywhere, but this is the norm.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first line of a Caddyfile is the address to listen on, for example:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-vhost">localhost:8080</span></code>

			<p>
				When you save that in a file called <code>Caddyfile</code>, Caddy will automatically find it when you start it:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="bash">$ caddy</code></pre>

			<p>
				If the Caddyfile is in a different location or has a different name, tell Caddy where it is:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="bash">$ caddy -conf="../path/to/Caddyfile"</code></pre>

			<p>
				The Caddyfile is really easy to use. Take a few minutes to learn the <a href="/docs/caddyfile">syntax of the Caddyfile</a>.
