			<h1>mime</h1>

			<p>
				mime sets the Content-Type in a response based on the file extension in the request.
			</p>

			<p>
				Normally, Content-Type is detected automatically, but this is not always possible. If you encounter responses with the wrong Content-Type, you can use this middleware to correct it.
			</p>



			<h3>Syntax</h3>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">mime</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>ext type</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>ext</b> is the file extension to match, including the dot prefix.</li>
				<li><b>type</b> is the Content-Type</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If you have a lot of MIME types to set, open a block:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">mime</span> {
	<i><span class="hl-subdirective">ext</span> type</i>
}
</code>

			<p>
				Each line defines a MIME extension-type pair. You can have as many lines as you need in a mime block.
			</p>


			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Customize the Content-Type of Flash files:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">mime</span> <span class="hl-arg">.swf application/x-shockwave-flash</span></code>

			<p>
				For multiple files:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">mime</span> {
	<span class="hl-subdirective">.swf</span> application/x-shockwave-flash
	<span class="hl-subdirective">.pdf</span> application/pdf
}</code>
