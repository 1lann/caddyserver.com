			<h1>import</h1>

			<p>
				import allows you to use configuration from another file. It gets replaced with the contents of that file.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a unique directive in that <code>import</code> can appear outside of a server block. In other words, it can appear at the top of a Caddyfile where an address would normally be. Like other directives, however, it cannot be used inside of other directives.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			
			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">import</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>pattern</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>pattern</b> is the file or glob pattern (<code>*</code>) to include. Its contents will replace this line, as if that file's contents appeared here to begin with.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Import a shared configuration:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">import</span> <span class="hl-arg">../config/common.conf</span></code>

			<p>
				Imports any files found in the vhosts folder:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">import</span> <span class="hl-arg">vhosts/*</span></code>
