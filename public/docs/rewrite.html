			<h1>rewrite</h1>

			<p>
				rewrite performs internal URL rewriting. This allows the client to request one resource but actually be served another without an HTTP redirect. Rewrites are invisible to the client.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are simple rewrites (fast) and complex rewrites (slower), but they're powerful enough to accommodate most dynamic back-end applications.
			</p>


			<h3>Syntax</h3>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>from to</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>from</b> is the exact path to match</li>
				<li><b>to</b> is the destination path to rewrite to (the resource to respond with)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Advanced users may open a block and make a complex rewrite rule:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> <span class="hl-arg">[<i>basepath</i>]</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">regexp</span> <i>pattern</i>
    <span class="hl-subdirective">ext</span>    <i>extensions...</i>
    <span class="hl-subdirective">if</span>     <i>a cond b</i>
    <span class="hl-subdirective">status</span> <i>code</i>
    <span class="hl-subdirective">to</span>     <i>destinations...</i>
}</code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>basepath</b> is the base path to match before rewriting with regular expression. Default is /.
				<li><b>regexp</b> (shorthand: <b>r</b>) will match the path with the given regular expression <b>pattern</b>. <mark>Extremely high-load servers should avoid using regular expressions.</mark></li>
				<li><b>extensions...</b> is a space-separated list of file extensions to include or ignore. Prefix an extension with <code>!</code> to exclude an extension. The forward slash <code>/</code> symbol matches paths without file extensions.</li>
				<li><b>if</b> specifies a rewrite condition. Multiple ifs are AND-ed together. <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are any string and may use <a href="/docs/placeholders">request placeholders</a>. <b>cond</b> is the condition, with possible values explained below.</li>
				<li><b>status</b> will respond with the given status <b>code</b> instead of performing a rewrite. In other words, use either "status" or "to" in your rule, but not both. The code must be a number in the format 4xx.
				<li><b>destinations...</b> is one or more space-separated paths to rewrite to, with support for <a href="/docs/placeholders">request placeholders</a> as well as numbered regular expression captures such as {1}, {2}, etc. Rewrite will check each destination in order and rewrite to the first destination that exists. Each one is checked as a file or, if ends with /, as a directory. The last destination will act as default if no other destination exists.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>"if" Conditions</h3>

			<p>
				The if keyword is a powerful way to describe your rule. It takes the format <code>a cond b</code>, where the values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are separated by <code>cond</code>, a condition. The condition can be any of these:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>is</code> = a equals b</li>
				<li><code>not</code> = a does NOT equal b</li>
				<li><code>has</code> = a has b as a substring (b is a substring of a)</li>
				<li><code>not_has</code> = b is NOT a substring of a</li>
				<li><code>starts_with</code> = b is a prefix of a</li>
				<li><code>ends_with</code> = b is a suffix of a</li>
				<li><code>match</code> = a matches b, where b is a regular expression</li>
				<li><code>not_match</code> = a does NOT match b, where b is a regular expression</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				When requests come in for /mobile, actually serve /mobile/index.
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> <span class="hl-arg">/mobile /mobile/index</span></code>

			<p>
				If the file is not favicon.ico and it is not a valid file or directory, serve the maintenance page if present, or finally, rewrite to index.php.
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">if</span> {file} not favicon.ico
    <span class="hl-subdirective">to</span> {path} {path}/ /maintenance.html /index.php
}</code>

			<p>
				If user agent includes "mobile" and path is not a valid file/directory, rewrite to the mobile index page.
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">if</span> if {>User-agent} has mobile
    <span class="hl-subdirective">to</span> {path} {path}/ /mobile/index.php
}</code>

			<p>
				If the request path starts with /source, respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden.
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">regexp</span> ^/source
    <span class="hl-subdirective">status</span> 403
}</code>

			<p>
				Rewrite /app to /index with a query string. <code>{1}</code> is the matched group <code>(.*)</code>.
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">rewrite</span> <span class="hl-arg">/app</span> {
    <span class="hl-subdirective">r</span>  (.*)
    <span class="hl-subdirective">to</span> /index?path={1}
}</code>
