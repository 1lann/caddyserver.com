				Warnings:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unless you use TLS with connections to your upload destination

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			
<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">upload</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>path</i></span> { 
	<span class="hl-subdirective">to</span>                  <i>"directory"</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">yes_without_tls</span>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_form</span>      <i>none|NFC|NFD</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_in</span>        <i>u0000–uff00 [u0000–uff00| …]</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">hmac_keys_in</span>        <i><em>keyID_0=</em>base64(binary) [keyID_n=base64(binary) | …]</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">timestamp_tolerance</span> <i>0..32</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">silent_auth_errors</span>
}</code>

			<h4>Required Settings</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>path</b> is the <i>scope</i> below which the plugin will react to any upload requests.
				It will be stripped and no part of any resulting files and directories.</li>
				<li><b>to</b> is an existing target directory. Must be in quotes.
				When using Linux it is recommended to place this on a filesystem which supports
				<em>O_TMPFILE</em>, such as (but not limited to) <i>ext4</i> or <i>XFS</i>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Optional Settings</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>yes_without_tls</b> must be set if the plugin is used on a location or host without TLS.</li>
				<li><b>filenames_form</b>: if given, filenames (this includes directories) that are not 
				conforming to Unicode NFC or NFD will be rejected.
				Set this to one of said values when you get errors indicating that your filesystem
				does not convert names properly. (If in doubt, go with NFC; on Mac PCs with NFD.)
				The default is to not enforce anything.</li>
				<li><b>filenames_in</b> allows you to limit filenames to specified Unicode ranges.
				The ranges' bounds must be given in hexadecimal and start with letter <code>u</code>.
				Use this setting to prevent users from uploading files in, for example, Cyrillic
				when all you like to see is Latin and/or Chinese alphabets.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Optional Settings (Authorization)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>hmac_keys_in</b> is a space-delimited list of key=value elements.
				The <em>key</em> is the KeyID, which could identify the uploading entity and which
				is a reference to a shared secret, the <em>value</em>.
				The latter is binary data, encoded using <em>base64</em>, with a recommended length of 32 octets.</li>
				<li><b>timestamp_tolerance</b> sets the validity of a request with authorization,
				and is used to account for clock drift difference between the
				uploader's and the server's computer.
				Always being an order of 2, its default value is 2 (as in: ± two seconds).
				Set this to 1 or 0 with reliably synchronized clocks.</li>
				<li><b>silent_auth_errors</b> results in the plugin returning no HTTP Errors.
				Instead, the request will be handed over to the next middleware, which
				then will most probably return a HTTP Error of its own.
				This is a cheap way to obscure that your site accepts uploads.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Tutorial</h3>

			<p>
				Start by adding this to your Caddyfile:
			</p>

<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">upload</span> <span class="hl-arg">/web/path</span> { 
	<span class="hl-subdirective">to</span> <i>"/var/tmp"</i>
}</code>

			<p>
				… and upload one file, using <em>bash</em> and <em>curl</em>:
			</p>

<code class="block"># HTTP PUT
curl \
  -T /etc/os-release \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/from-release
</code>

			<p>
				… or more files in one go (sub-directories will be created as needed):
			</p>

<code class="block"># HTTP POST
curl \
  -F gitconfig=@.gitconfig \
  -F id_ed25519.pub=@.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/
</code>

			<p>
				… which you then can move and delete like this:
			</p>

<code class="block"># MOVE is 'mv'
curl -X MOVE \
  -H "Destination: /web/path/to-release" \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/from-release

# DELETE is 'rm -r'
curl -X DELETE \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/to-release
</code>

			<h3>Authorization Scheme <q>Signature</q></h3>

			<p>
				This plugin comes with support for request authorization scheme <em>Signature</em>,
				but does not support its <i>realms</i> or any other <i>algorithm</i> than <em>hmac-sha256</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				A pre-shared secret, referenced by <em>keyId</em> in the header,
				is used together with a nonce—the concatenation of the current Unix time and a free-form string—
				in a HMAC scheme.
				In the end a header <em>Authorization</em> is sent formatted like this along with the two latter values:
			</p>

<code class="block">Authorization: Signature keyId="(key_id)",algorithm="hmac-sha256",headers="timestamp token",signature="(see below)"
Timestamp: (current UNIX time)
Token: (some chars, to promote the timestamp to a full nonce)
</code>

			<p>
				You can generate new keys easily on the shell:
			</p>

<code class="block">SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# printf "%s\n" "${SECRET}"
# TWF0dCBIb2x0IGRvZXNuJ3QgdXBkYXRlIGhpcyBNYWM=
</code>

			<p>
				A full script for uploading something would be:
			</p>

<code class="block">#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

# hmac_keys_in mark=Z2VoZWlt
#
KEYID="mark"
SECRET="geheim"

TIMESTAMP="$(date --utc +%s)"
# length and contents are not important, "abcdef" would work as well
TOKEN="$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -d -c '[:alnum:]' | head -c $(( 32 - ${#TIMESTAMP} )))"

SIGNATURE="$(printf "${TIMESTAMP}${TOKEN}" \
             | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "${SECRET}" -binary \
             | openssl enc -base64)"

# order does not matter; any skipped fields in Authorization will be set to defaults
curl -T \
	--header "Timestamp: ${TIMESTAMP}" \
	--header "Token: ${TOKEN}" \
	--header "Authorization: Signature keyId='${KEYID}',signature='${SIGNATURE}'" \
	"filename" "url"
</code>

			<h3>Configuration Examples</h3>

			<p>
				A host used by someone in Central and West Europe would be configured like this
				to accept filenames in Latin with some Greek runes and a few mathematical symbols:
			</p>

<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">upload</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>/college/curriculum</i></span> { 
	<span class="hl-subdirective">to</span>                  <i>"/home/ellen_baker/inbox"</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_form</span>      <i>NFC</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_in</span>        <i>u0000–u007F u0100–u017F u0391–u03C9 u2018–u203D u2152–u217F</i>
}</code>

			<p>
				A host for Linux distribution packages would be more restrictive:
			</p>

<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">upload</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>/binhost/gentoo</i></span> { 
	<span class="hl-subdirective">to</span>                  <i>"/var/portage/packages"</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_in</span>        <i>u0000–u007F</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">hmac_keys_in</span>        <i>hina=aGluYQ==</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">timestamp_tolerance</span> <i>0</i>
}</code>

			<p>
				… while someone in East Asia would share space on his blog with three friends:
			</p>

<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">upload</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>/wp-uploads</i></span> { 
	<span class="hl-subdirective">to</span>                  <i>"/var/www/senpai/wp-uploads"</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">filenames_in</span>        <i>u0000–u007F u0100–u017F u0391–u03C9 u2018–u203D u3000–u303f u3040–u309f u30a0–u30ff u4e00–9faf uff00–uffef</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">hmac_keys_in</span>        <i>yui=eXVp hina=aGluYQ== olivia=b2xpdmlh james=amFtZXM=</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">timestamp_tolerance</span> <i>3</i>
	<span class="hl-subdirective">silent_auth_errors</span>
}</code>
