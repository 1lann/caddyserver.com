			<h1>startup</h1>

			<p>
				startup executes a command when the server begins. This is useful for preparing to serve a site by running a script or starting a background process like php-fpm. (Also see <a href="/docs/shutdown">shutdown</a>.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Each command that is executed at startup is blocking, unless you suffix the command with a space and <code>&amp;</code>, which will cause the command to be run in the background. The output and error of the command go to stdout and stderr, respectively. There is no stdin.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even if this directive is shared by more than one host, the command will only execute once.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">startup</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>command</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>command</b> is the command to execute; it may be followed by arguments</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Start php-fpm before the server starts listening:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">startup</span> <span class="hl-arg">/etc/init.d/php-fpm start</span></code>
