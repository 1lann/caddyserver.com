			<h1>root</h1>

			<p>
				root simply specifies the root of the site. This is very useful, in fact required, if the root (/) directory of the website is not the same as where Caddy is being executed from.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">root</span> <span class="hl-arg"><i>path</i></span></code>

			<ul>
				<li><b>path</b> is the directory to set as the site root</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				Serve the website out of Jake's public_html folder instead of the current working directory:
			</p>

			<code class="block"><span class="hl-directive">root</span> <span class="hl-arg">/home/jake/public_html</span></code>
