			<h1>shutdown</h1>

			<p>
				shutdown executes a command when the server exits. This is useful for performing cleanup or stopping a background process like php-fpm. (Also see <a href="/docs/startup">startup</a>.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Each command that is executed at shutdown is blocking. The output and error of the command go to stdout and stderr, respectively. There is no stdin.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that shutdown commands will not execute if Caddy is force-terminated, for example, by using a "Force Quit" feature provided by your operating system. However, a typical SIGINT (Ctrl+C) will allow the shutdown commands to execute.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even if this directive is shared by more than one host, the command will only execute once.
			</p>
