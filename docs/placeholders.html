			<h1>Placeholders</h1>

			<p>
				Some directives allow you to use placeholders in your Caddyfile to fill out a value differently for every request. For example, the value <code>{path}</code> would be replaced by the path portion of the request URL. These are also called replaceable values.
			</p>

			<mark class="block">
				These placeholders only work on directives that support them. Check the documentation for your directive to see if placeholders are supported.
			</mark>

			<h3>Request Placeholders</h3>

			<p>
				These values are obtained from the request.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>{fragment}</b> - The part of the URL after (and including) "#"</li>
				<li><b>{>Header}</b> - Any request header, where "Header" is the header field name</li>
				<li><b>{host}</b> - The host portion of the request</li>
				<li><b>{method}</b> - The request method (GET, POST, etc.)</li>
				<li><b>{path}</b> - The path portion of the URL (does not include query string or fragment)</li>
				<li><b>{port}</b> - The port</li>
				<li><b>{proto}</b> - The protocol string (e.g. "HTTP/1.1")</li>
				<li><b>{query}</b> - The query string portion of the URL, without leading "?"</li>
				<li><b>{remote}</b> - The client's IP address</li>
				<li><b>{scheme}</b> - The protocol/scheme used (usually http or https)</li>
				<li><b>{uri}</b> - The request URI (includes path, query string, and fragment)</li>
				<li><b>{when}</b> - Timestamp in the format <code>02/Jan/2006:15:04:05 -0700</code></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Response Placeholders</h3>

			<p>
				These values are obtained from the response, and are only implemented with some directives. Make sure your directive supports response placeholders before attempting to use them.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>{latency}</b> - Approximate time the server spent handling the request</li>
				<li><b>{size}</b> - The size of the response body</li>
				<li><b>{status}</b> - The HTTP status code of the response</li>
			</ul>
